	<h1>We can play audio pretty easily with JavaScript! We just need to make sure we include the audio files in the same repository as our .html file or correctly linked to.</h1>
	<p>We unfortunately arenâ€™t allowed to play audio automatically when we load a page.</p>

	<button onclick="playAudio('assets/hello.mp3')">Hello</button>
	<button onclick="playAudio('assets/hi.mp3')">Hi</button>
	<button onclick="playAudio('assets/whatsup.mp3')">Whats up</button>
	<button onclick="playAudio('assets/whoareyou.mp3')">Who are you</button>

	<br><br>

	<button onmouseover="playAudio('assets/whoareyou.mp3')">This audio plays on mouseover, but is unable to play until the user clicks the page at least once.</button>

	<script>
		function playAudio(fileName) {
			var audio = new Audio(fileName);
			audio.play();
